# Variables, data types and operators

## Variables
- Variables are used to store data values
- in JS, variables can be declared with `var`, `let` or `const`
- `var` is the oldest way of declaring variables
- while `let` and `const` are introduced in ES6 feature
- `let` and `const` have blocked scope, `var` has function scope

```javascript
var age = 22;
let name = "Shaik";
const PI = 3.14;
```

## Data Types
JS has several data types, including
- Numbers: integers (`23` or `-789`) and floating point (`90.78`) number
- Strings: text (`'Shaik'`, `"Sharuf"`)
- Booleans: `true` / `false` values
- Objects: key-values pairs `{key: value}`
- Arrays: ordered lists of values (here values could be any data type) `[6, "test", true, [], {}, null, undefined]`
- null: Absence of value
- undefined

## Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on values
JS has several types of operators, including
- Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (it will return `String`, `Number`, `NaN`)
- Assigment Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` (Always return `boolean`)
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!` (Always return `boolean`)

```javascript
'Shaik' + 3
```
