## Object Spread Operator

The object spread operator is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to create new objects by combining properties from one or more existing objects. 

This can make your code more concise and easier to read.

### Syntax
The syntax for the object spread operator in JavaScript is as follows:
```javascript
const newObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2, ... };
```

---

Here's an example:
```javascript
Example 1
const obj1 = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
};

const obj2 = {
  hobbies: ['reading', 'traveling'],
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Anytown',
    state: 'CA',
    zip: '12345'
  }
};

const newObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
console.log(newObj); // Output: { name: 'John', age: 30, hobbies: ['reading', 'traveling'], address: { street: '123 Main St', city: 'Anytown', state: 'CA', zip: '12345' } }

Example 2
var userone = {
  name : "Shaik",
  age  : 35
}
var info = {
  job      : "Developer",
  location : "Hyderabad"
}

var details = {...userone, ...info}
console.log(details)  
// Output
/*
 age: 35,
  job: "Developer",
  location: "Hyderabad",
  name: "Shaik"
}
*/
Example with Arrays 1

const evens = [3,4,5,6];
const odds = [7,8,9,0]

const numbers = [...evens, ...odds]
console.log(numbers) // Output [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]



Rest Operator Example 
const evens   = [3,4,5,6];
const odds    = [7,8,9,0]
const numbers = [...evens, ...odds,3] // This is Spread operator

const [first,second,...remaining] = numbers 
console.log(first);       // Output 3
console.log(second);     // Output 4
console.log(remaining); // Output [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3]
```

In this example, we have defined two objects `obj1` and `obj2` with several properties. We have then combined the properties from both objects into a new object `newObj` using the object spread operator.

---

### Overriding Properties
You can also use the object spread operator to override properties in an object. 

Here's an example:
```javascript
const obj1 = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
};

const obj2 = {
  age: 35,
  hobbies: ['reading', 'traveling'],
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Anytown',
    state: 'CA',
    zip: '12345'
  }
};

const newObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
console.log(newObj); // Output: { name: 'John', age: 35, hobbies: ['reading', 'traveling'], address: { street: '123 Main St', city: 'Anytown', state: 'CA', zip: '12345' } }
```

In this example, we have defined two objects `obj1` and `obj2` with several properties. We have then combined the properties from both objects into a new object `newObj` using the object spread operator. 

Since both objects have an `age` property, the value from `obj2` overrides the value from `obj1`.

---

### Adding Properties
You can also use the object spread operator to add new properties to an object. 

Here's an example:
```javascript
Example 1
const obj1 = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
};
const newObj = { ...obj1, occupation: 'engineer' };
console.log(newObj); // Output: { name: 'John', age: 30, occupation: 'engineer' }


Example 2
var userone = {
  name : "Shaik",
  age  : 35
}
var info = {
  job      : "Developer",
  location : "Hyderabad"
}

var details = {...userone, ...info,company : "turpy"}
console.log(details) // Output { age: 35,company: "turpy",job: "Developer",location: "Hyderabad",name: "Shaik"}


Example with Arrays 1
const evens = [3,4,5,6];
const odds = [7,8,9,0]

const numbers = [...evens, ...odds,3]
console.log(numbers) // Output [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3]
```

In this example, we have defined an object `obj1` with several properties. We have then added a new `occupation` property to the object `newObj` using the object spread operator.

### Conclusion
The object spread operator is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows you to create new objects by combining properties from one or more existing objects. 

It can make your code more concise and easier to read, and it allows you to override existing properties or add new ones to an object.
