## Higher-order Functions

---

In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be treated as values and passed around like any other value. Higher-order functions are functions that take one or more functions as arguments or return a function as their result. They can be used to create more flexible and reusable code.

---

### Functions as arguments
A function that takes another function as an argument is called a higher-order function. 

This allows us to pass behavior as a parameter to the function, which can then use that behavior to produce a result. 

---

Here is an example of a higher-order function that takes a callback function:
```javascript
Example 1
function performOperation(num1, num2, operation) {
  return operation(num1, num2);
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

const result1 = performOperation(10, 5, add);
const result2 = performOperation(10, 5, subtract);

console.log(result1); // Output: 15
console.log(result2); // Output: 5




Example 2
function add(a,b){
return a+b;
}
                  
function subract(a,b){
return a-b;
}
                  
function multiply(a,b){
return a*b;
}
                  
function division(a,b){
return a/b;
}

           // 10,   20  , function
function calc(a = 0,b= 0,operator){
return operator()
}
               
const addition       = add(10,20);
const Minus          = subract(10,20);
const Multiplication = multiply(10,20);
const Div            = division(10,20);
                  
console.log(addition); // 30
console.log(Minus);    // -10
console.log(Multiplication) // 200
console.log(Div) // 0.5
```
A higher-order function that takes a function as an argument is called a callback function. 

In this example, `performOperation` is a higher-order function that takes two numbers and a callback function (`operation`). The `performOperation` function calls the callback function with the two numbers as arguments and returns the result. The `add` and `subtract` functions are callback functions that are passed as arguments to `performOperation`.

---

### Functions as return values
A function can also return another function as its result. This can be useful when we want to create a function that has different behavior based on some condition. 

Here is an example of a function that returns a function:
```javascript
Example 1
const add = "+";
const subract = "-";
const multiply = "*";
const division = "/";
                  
calc();

function calc(a,b,operator){
let total ;
switch(operator){
case add:
total = a+b;
break;
case subract :
total = a-b;
break;
case multiply:
total = a*b;
break;
case division:
total = a/b;
break;
default:
total = NaN;                      
}
return total;
}



Example 2
function getOperation(operator) {
  if (operator === '+') {
    return function(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    };
  } else if (operator === '-') {
    return function(a, b) {
      return a - b;
    };
  } else {
    return function(a, b) {
      return 0;
    };
  }
}

const addFunction = getOperation('+');
const subtractFunction = getOperation('-');
const unknownFunction = getOperation('unknown');

const result1 = addFunction(10, 5);
const result2 = subtractFunction(10, 5);
const result3 = unknownFunction(10, 5);

console.log(result1); // Output: 15
console.log(result2); // Output: 5
console.log(result3); // Output: 0
```
In this example, the `getOperation` function returns a different function based on the value of the `operator` argument. The returned function is then assigned to a variable (`addFunction`, `subtractFunction`, or `unknownFunction`) and called with two arguments.

### Real-world use cases
Higher-order functions are used in many real-world scenarios, such as:

- Array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, which take functions as arguments to manipulate and transform array elements.
- Event handlers in web development, where a function is passed as a callback to be executed when an event occurs.
- Promises in JavaScript, which use functions as arguments to handle success and failure cases.


Overall, higher-order functions are a powerful and flexible tool that can help make our code more modular and reusable.
