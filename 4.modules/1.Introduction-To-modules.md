## Introduction to Modules

### What are Modules?

Modules are a way to organize and encapsulate JavaScript code. They provide a way to split your code into separate files, making it easier to manage and maintain your codebase.

In JavaScript, modules are files that contain code and can be imported and exported using a specific syntax.

### Real-time use case
Suppose you are working on a project that requires you to build a web application that allows users to search for movies and TV shows. You might want to organize your code into separate modules, such as:

- A `search.js` module that handles searching for movies and TV shows.
- A `ui.js` module that handles updating the user interface.
- A `api.js` module that handles making requests to an external API.

By splitting your code into separate modules, you can make it easier to manage and maintain your codebase. You can also reuse modules in other projects or share them with other developers.
